Description: Tipping point analysis for clinical trials that employ Bayesian dynamic borrowing via robust meta-analytic predictive (MAP) priors. Mainly an implementation of an approach proposed by Best and colleagues (2021) is provided <doi:10.1002/pst.2093>. Intended use is the planning, analysis and interpretation of extrapolation studies in pediatric drug development, but applicability is generally wider.
